# Vote Simulator

What the heck is this!? Saw a post on Reddit then saw a post on Twitter which talks about some interesting numbers. I just happened to remember some things happened on similar projects I've worked on so decided to play around a bit

How does this work!? Just put any number on that white box thingy below and that would be considered the number of votes you wanna play around with. You can put millions, tens of millions, etc... Then click on the button below it and it should render some results below.

(Apologies if I didn't link anything properly as I have no idea how to use Social Media :))
